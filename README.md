This is a basic game called TIC TAC TOE. There are 9 empty boxes arranged in a 3 by 3 cube. The players turn simultaneously after every move. Two players can play at a time, Player X and Player O. The player X will touch the box and will place a X in that box. Then the turn changes and vice versa for Player O. A player will win if they get 3 times X in a row, or 3 times in a column ,or 3 times in a diagonals before the other player and vice versa.
